## Chat Commands

> `/flood start [area] (a1-a8)` - Start the round (optional: provide area)

> `/flood hardmode` - Doubles the speed multiplier for all areas

> `/flood speed` - Set the speed multiplier manually

## Known Issues

* Sometimes the timer gets stuck at 0.0 and the server might need to be reset. Sometimes running start with a selected area fixes it.
